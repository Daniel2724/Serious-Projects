# Serious-Projects
>Collection of my personal projects where there is some sort of complexity and logical problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first project was a project to make a softwere to count a votes in favor (1) or againgst (2).

It was the first project were I used "while".

It was preaty easy :-).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second project is School_Grades_2.java

It need to take the grades from all the classes.

colculate th average of the grades for each class spesific and for all clases together.

and even a littel bit more.

And why it is _2.

Simply couse i wote a code like this befor but it was bad and i wrote it again.

It was the first project were i use a lot of while loops (and in some point it started to be a mess because I forgot to write a code line that will make zero every variable in the while loop)

(Here I am 15.5 year all and in the middle of my second month in software engineering)
