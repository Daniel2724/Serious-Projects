# Serious-Projects
>Collection of my personal projects where there is some sort of complexity and logical problem.

## First Seriouse Project
The first project was a project to make a softwere to count a votes in favor (1) or againgst (2).

It was the first project were I used "while".

It was preaty easy :-).

## Second Project
The second project is School_Grades_2.java

* It need to take the grades from all the classes.
* Colculate th average of the grades for each class spesific and for all clases together.
* And even a littel bit more.
> And why it is School_Grades_2 ? : Simply because I wrote a code like this before but it was bad and i wrote it again.
> It was the first project were I use a lot of while loops (and in some point it started to be a mess because I forgot to write a code line that will make zero every variable in the while loop)
